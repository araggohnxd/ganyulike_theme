# About the Ganyulike Theme

- Guess I just wanted my VSCode to match my Terminal. That's pretty much it. <br>
- The colors in this theme are inspired by resyfer's Windows Terminal theme, called "Ganyu" (he's a fellow Genshin player).
- This is my first ever VSCode theme and I didn't really put that much effort into it. I code mostly in C, so it's probably very clunky for C and even clunkier for other languages.
- Hope you enjoy it!
